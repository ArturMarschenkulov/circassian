This folder is about gathering all the varioues resources and data, which I find important for learning Kabardian.

Of course, I will try to include ALL resources I can find in regards to Kabardian itself (Eastern Circassian). Adyghe (Western Circassian) is closely related and there I will try to also include all resources I can find.

Ubykh and the Abazo-Abkhaz languages are less important, but since they are related still relevant. So I will try to include resources about them as well.

In addition, I'll also include sporadically resources about other Caucasian languages.

On top of that, there will be non-Caucasian languages which I might include here, be it for reference or whatever. Especially the Native northern american languages have relatively many parallels to Kabardian, like Tlingit, so I might include it here too.



I will also list in this file, various authors who are relevant.
