This folder is about gathering all the various resources about, in this order of importance, Kabardian (eastern Caucasian), Adyghe (western Caucasian), Abazo-Abkhaz and Caucasian languages.

The main goal of this folder is to gather ALL resources on the Kabardian language (`kabardian/`), no matter how irrelevant it is. Then comes Adyghe resources, those are not as important as Kabardian, but considering there many many parallels, I'll gather them too. 

Abazo-Abkhaz and Ubykh resources will be also gathered, but more so because they are closely related languages with relatively little documentation.

I will also gather resources about other Caucasian languages.

I will also list in this file, various authors who are relevant.
