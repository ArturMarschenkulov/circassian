This is a grammar guide to Kabardian. The goal of this guide is to be a mixture of formal grammar and learning book for Kabardian.

The exact form of this guide is not clear yet. Whether it will be a linear path OR whether it will be a "blog like" approach, where I simply write various blogs talking about a language. Maybe I will do both in a mixture. That remains to be seen.

About me. While I have Circassian family, I myself am unfortunately not a native speaker. This guide and adjacent notes, are my attempt to learn the language by writing articles which can be understood by others.
