# Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to create a conjugator for Eastern Circassian, aka Kabardian, verbs for Wikipsalhalhe.

However, the long term goal is to create a general conjugator for Kabardian and in the future also Western Circassian and maybe even Abkhaz or Abaza, so that other projects may use this, if they want.
