In this repo I write down all my personal learning and the various resources I could have found about Circassian, mainly Kabardian or East Circassian. Right now it is mostly only for personal-consumption, but I do hope that some files can be used as blog articles in the future.

Note I use `Obsidian` to view the files, and it is thus also recommended that if you want to have a good experience that you get `Obsidian` running.

# Goals

My long term goal is to create learning resource for Kabardian. In my opinion, the best way to do that is in the English language. Personally, whenver I see resources about the language, it is in Arabic, Russian or Turkish. This makes certainly sense, because most Circassians either live in Homeland, that is in Russia, or  in Diaspora, that is in Turkey or in Arabic speaking countries. This is problematic, because it is a major barrier for people who do not speak these languages. English is different, because if somebody knows a foreign language it is English and even if English is not known, there are good online translators from English to Russian, Turkish and Arabic, especially the new AI ones like Deepl. This is why I think that English is the best language to create learning resources for Kabardian.

# Contribution

If you like to contribute to this repo, please feel free to contact me! Or if you only have similar goals as me.

You are also free to use my material however you like, but if you are posting something publically with it, I would like to be contacted and credited. Let's say you want to create a blog, you can simply copy paste anything which I have written in this repo, however I would like that you properly mention me somewhere on your website and that you contact me. This is mainly so that one can stay in touch and help each other out and so that my work gets seen by more people.


# Repository Structure
The `Lesson` directory has articles that are similar to blog posts. These are essentially my notes as I learn more the Kabardian language. My goal is to evolve this directory into a blog-like format that others can learn fro too. The `Lesson/Expressing` directory is the closest to this, and I might rename it to `Lesson/Blog` in the future. I'd prefer to post these blogs on a dedicated website, but for now, this will have to do. Later on, one could simply copy paste stuff from here or use this as a base.

In `grammar-book`, one can find the grammar book which I am writing. This is a long term project and I intend to only write stuff down, if I have thoroughly understood it. This book is intended to be a mixture of linguistics book and book for learning the language. This means that while this book will use a lot of linguistic jargon, it will also try to explain it in a plain and understandable way for non-linguists. In addition, there one also might write down cultural and historical stuff about Circassian in general. Maybe the name of this book will change in the future, because of its long term scope.

In `subproj`, one can find various subprojects that I was or am working on. In a way this just a place to put my other related work, so that I do not have to create a new repo for each of them. Though maybe that would happen in the future. Especially, `subproj/wikipsalhalhe_templates` might become one in the future. It started of as a project to create verb conjugation templates for the Kabardian Wiktionary, also called [Wikipsalhalhe/Википсалъальэ](https://kbd.wiktionary.org/). But it might become one day its own repo, if it becomes bigger.

In `Kabardian Dictionary` I have an attempt at creating a dictionary for Kabardian. It is as of right now not worked on anymore and probably will not be worked on in the future. I started this, because I found the idea of using Obsidian's graph functionality interesting as this would allow to visually understand words better and their relations. The problem is also that it does not use the official Cyrillic script, but IPA. At the time it was more readable for me. Retrospectivey, that was a mistake because people are not too familiar with IPA and might find that too difficult to read.
