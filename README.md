"# grammar-kabaridan" 

In this repo I write down all my personal learning and the various resources I could have found. Right now it is mostly only for personal-consumption, but I do hope that some files can be used as blog articles in the future.

Note I use `Obsidian` to view the files, and it is thus also recommended that if you want to have a good experience that you get `Obsidian` running.
