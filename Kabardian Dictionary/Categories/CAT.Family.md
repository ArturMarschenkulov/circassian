This category is about family.

**_aːda_** and **_aːna_**  denote "father" and "mother" respectively.
**_daːda_** and **_naːna_** denote "grandfatehr" and "grandmother" respectively. **_aːdaʃxʷa_** and **_aːnaʃxʷa_** are more formal ways to denote the same.

**_qʷa_** is the term for "son".
**_qʷaʃ_** the term for "brother" (for a sister). It seems that that word is a compound noun between **_qʷa_** "son" and **_ʃə_** which is an archaic way to refer to "brother"

While **_pχʷə_** now means "daughter", it probably meant "woman" or something along those lines, which then would explain **_ʃəpχʷ_** "sister", which back then could have meant "female sibling".

While **_qʷaʃ_** is the term for "brother" for a male, **_daɬxʷ_** is strictly for a female's brother
