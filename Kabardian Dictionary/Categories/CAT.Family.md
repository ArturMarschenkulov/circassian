This category is about family.

**_адэ_** and **_анэ_**  denote "father" and "mother" respectively.
**_дадэ_** and **_нанэ_** denote "grandfatehr" and "grandmother" respectively. **_адэшхуэ_** and **_анэшхуэ_** are more formal ways to denote the same.

**_къуэ_** is the term for "son".
**_къуэш_** the term for "brother" (for a sister). It seems that that word is a compound noun between **_къуэ_** "son" and **_шы_** which is an archaic way to refer to "brother"

While **_пхъу_** now means "daughter", it probably meant "woman" or something along those lines, which then would explain **_шыпхъу_** "sister", which back then could have meant "female sibling".

While **_къуэш_** is the term for "brother" for a male, **_дэлъху_** is strictly for a female's brother
