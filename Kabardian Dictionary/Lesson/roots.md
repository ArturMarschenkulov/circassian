In my view Kabardian seems to have very few roots, especially verbal roots. It rather prefers to derive new verbs. This note should be a listing of such roots.

**_marʃanqʷəɮ_**

**_xə-_** - _to go/come down_
**_tʃʼə-_** - _to grow_
# Independent roots
**_kʷʼə-_** - _to  go_
**_ɬata-_** - _to fly_
**_ɬaːʁʷa-_** - _to look (actively)_
**_ɬəχʷa-_** - _to look for, to search_
# Non free roots
those are roots, which don't appear (at least to my knowledge, as independent)
**_tsʼaft-_** - _quickly exit something_
	**_jətsʼaftən** - _pop/jump out_, _lightly get out of somewhere _
	**_xatsʼaftən** - _pop out, fly out, run out of sth._
	**_tajtsʼaftən** - _quickly come off the surface of sth_
