It is useful to differentiate verbs depending on their smenatic content, because this can help out how the grammar works on it plus what types of derivation is possible, usually speaking.

Kabardian verbs are usually derived verbs, so I will try to only give the most sensible minimal roots.

On this page I will also try to gather all the "basic roots", mainly for verbs, but others as well.


# Temp
This is a temporary location for basic stems I have found.

**_ɬaʔʷan_** - _to request_
**_bɣan_** - _to curse_


# Verbs of motion
Verbs of motion are:
>- **_ɬatan_** - _to fly_
>- **_kʷʼatan_** - _to move_
>- **_pɕən_** - _to crawl_
>- **_ʒan_** - _to run_
>- **_tʃʼan_**
>- **_ɬadan_** - _to run fast_
>- **_ɬan_** - _to jump_
>- ?**_tsʼaftan_**
>-  ==
>- **_ʃan_** - _to lead Y_
>- **_ɬafən_** - _to drag Y_
>- **dzən** - _to throw Y_
>- **_ħən_**


# Bound stems
Note: There is another term for that.

Kabardian has a few verbal stems with a clear meaning, where maybe in the past was also used by itself, but now it has to be used bounded with some other morpheme.

Those bound roots' basic forms are usually with the preverb **_ɕə-_**.
>- **_sə-_** refers to sitting. **_ɕəsən_** - _to sit_
>- **_tə-_** refers to standing. **_ɕətən_** - _to stand_
>- **_ɬə-_** refers to lying. **_ɕəɬən_** - _to lie_
>- 
>- **_ɕat-_** refers to falling or slipping from something. **_ɕəɕatən_** - _to fall/slip from Y_

The below are special, as they can be suffixed to verbs as well as being combined with preverbs.
>- **_ħa-_** refers to moving towards (entering).
>- **_tʃʼə-_** refers to moving away (exiting).
>- **_xə-_** refers to moving down.
>- **_jə-_** refers to moving up.
