The Kabardian verb conjugation paradigm is very complex.

The verb can be divided into several group, which determine how the verb is to be conjugated.


abs-(erg)-stem
# Transitivity
The main overarching category for a verb is transitivity. A verb can be transitive (**_лъэIэс_**) and intransitive (**_лъэмыIэс_**). The main difference is that a base intransitive verb governs only over 1 argument, the subject in the absolutive/nominative case (**_-р_**), while a base transitive verb governs over 2 arguments, the subject in the ergative case (**_-м_**) and the direct object in the absolutive/nominative case (**_-р_**).

Below the intransitive verb **_плъэн_** _to look_ and transitive verb **_лъагъун_** _to see Y_ are used to demonstrate that. With **_лIы_** _man_ and **_жыг_** _tree_.

>- **_лIыр плъэнщ_** - _the man will look_
>- **_лIым жыгыр илъагъунщ_** - _the man will see the tree_

However, in both cases, those base verbs can get indirect objects in the ergative case (**_-м_**), usually by deploying preverbs. A frequent example is the use of the preverb **_е-_** with intransitive verbs, which is a very generic way to add an indirect object. In many ways it is equivalent to 'to' or 'at' or the French 'à'. Thus leading to the verb **_еплъын_** (not that **_э_** became **_ы_**).

>- **_лIыр жыгым еплъынщ_** - _the man will look at the tree_
>- **_лIым жыгыр илъэгъунщ_** - _the man will see the tree_

As one can see, intransitive and transitive verbs can have 2 arguments and if that is the case the cases are switched. While with an intransitive with 2 arguments the subject is in the absolutive/nominative with an (indirect) object in the ergative, the transitive verb has it the other way around, the subject is in the ergative case while the (direct) object is in the absolutive/nominative. 

Important to note, that while morphologically there is only one ergative case, it is useful to differentiate between the 'pure' ergative and the oblique case. The 'pure' usage would be only in regards to the use as subject, while the oblique usage would be everything else. More on that later.
## Patterns
There are certain patterns in regards to verbs and transitivity.

Base stems for motion verbs are for the most part intransitive.

In perception verbs, intransitive ones indicate more agency while that's less so the case with transitive verbs. Compare:
**_сыноплъащ_** _I looked at you_ vs **_услъэгъуащ_** _I saw you_
**_сынодэIуащ_** _I listened to you_ vs **_узэхэсхащ_** _I heard you_

## Syntactical and morphological transitivity
Most Kabardian verbs have  morphologically and syntactically the same transitivity, yet some verbs are special.

### Morphologically transitive, syntactically intranstive   
Basically, simply by looking at their morphology one would assume that it is a normal transitive, yet semantically/syntactically this is not the case. One can divide them up into several types.

#### Type 0
These verbs are flexible. Either they can remain "normal" or their 

>- **_ухын_** (**_еух_**) _to end Y_
>	- **_илъэсым иухащ_** - _the year started_
>	- **_ар илъэсым иухащ_** - _he started the year_
>- **_щIэдзэн_** (**_щIедзэ_**) _to begin Y_
>	- **_урокым щIидзащ_** - _the class started_
>	- **абы урокыр щIидзащ** - _he/she started the class_
>	- **_жэщ сменэм вэн щIидзакIэщ_** - _the night shift started plowing_

#### Type 1

>
>- **_къэкIухьын_** (**_къекIухь_**) _to walk_
>	- **__**
### Morphologically intransitive, syntactically transtive

**_щыгъупщэн_** _to forget_ is morphologically intransitive, yet it acts like a transitive verb


>-**_сыпщыгъупщэнщ_** /**_səpɕəʁʷəpɕanɕ_**/ - _you will forget me_
>

The most important overarching category is transitivity. Both transitive (**_ɬaʔas_**) and intransitive (**_ɬaməʔas_**) verbs can have multiple persons marked. The main difference is the order of the personal prefixes and what case the subject and object take.

The main differences is that the subject of intransitive verbs is in the absolutive case (**_-r_**) (however it is also frequently called nominative), while the subject of the transitive verb is in the ergative case (**_-m_**).  An intransitive verb can only have indirect objects, which always have the ergative case (**_-m_**), while transitive verbs can have direct objects (**_-r_**) and indirect objects (**_-m_**), though they can't be without an object. However usually when a transitive object has 2 persons it's the subject and direct object. Meaning that effectively speaking, the cases switch between intransitive and transitive verbs.

>- **_ɬʼər ʒəɣəm jawpɬ_** - _the man looks at the tree_
>- **_лIыр жыгым йоплъ_**
>- **_ɬʼəm ʒəɣər jaɬaːʁʷ_** - _the man sees the tree  _

The two verbs are **_japɬən_** _to look at Y_ and **_ɬaʁʷən_** _to see Y_, the former is intransitive, the later transitive, but both take 2 persons. While this parallel in the English language might only be a coincidence, it's actually a good analogy, because indirect objects can always be seen as 'preposition' + 'object', like 'at/to him'.

Below is a short overview of the different conjugations:
>- **_sawpɬ_** vs **_sawɬaʁʷ_** - _I look at Y_ vs _I see Y_
>- **_səpɬaːɕ_** vs **_sɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _I looked at Y_ vs _I saw Y_
>- **_qəzawpɬ_** vs **_sajɬaʁʷ_** - _X looks at me_ vs _X sees me_
>- **_qəzapɬaːɕ_** vs **_səjɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _X looked at me_ vs _X saw me_
>- **_sənawpɬ_** vs **_wəzawɬaʁʷ_** - _I look at you_ vs _I see you_
>- **_sənawpɬaːɕ_** vs **_wəsɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _I looked at you_ vs _I saw you_
>- **_wəqəzawpɬ_** vs **_səbawɬaʁʷ_** - _you look at me_ vs _you see me_
>- **_wəqəzapɬaːɕ_** vs **_səpɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _you looked at me_ vs _you saw me_

>- **_соплъ_** vs **_солъэгъу_** - _I look at Y_ vs _I see Y_
>- **_сыплъащ_** vs **_слъэгъуащ_** - _I looked at Y_ vs _I saw Y_
>- **_къызоплъ_** vs **_sajɬaʁʷ_** - _X looks at me_ vs _X sees me_
>- **_къызэплъащ_** vs **_səjɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _X looked at me_ vs _X saw me_
>- **_сыноплъ_** vs **_wəzawɬaʁʷ_** - _I look at you_ vs _I see you_
>- **_сыноплъащ_** vs **_wəsɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _I looked at you_ vs _I saw you_
>- **_укъызоплъ_** vs **_səbawɬaʁʷ_** - _you look at me_ vs _you see me_
>- **_укъызэплъащ_** vs **_səpɬaʁʷaːɕ_** - _you looked at me_ vs _you saw me_

As you might have noticed, it seems like the order has changed. In intransitive verbs the marker for the subject comes first and then the indirect object, while in intransitive verbs the marker for the direct object comes first and then subject. And this is true, however one can also regard it as having the same order, if you analyze it as (abs)-(erg as indirect object)-(erg as subject). 

> - **wə**qəzapɬaːɕ _**you** looked at me_ vs **wə**sɬaʁʷaːɕ _I saw **you**_
> - **sə**pɬaːɕ _**I** looked at Y_ vs **s**əjɬaʁʷaːɕ _X looks at **me**_

**_sə-_** and **_wə-_** are in this case absolutive person markers for the first and second person singular. **_s-_** and **_jə-_** are the ergative markers. Notice that ergative markers are absent from intransitive verbs.

Simplified, the absolutive always comes first. In case of intransitive verbs, it's the subject. In case of transitive verbs it's the direct object. Intransitive verbs don't have the ergative as the subject slot, so it's simply skipped. And while not mentioned above, there are some 3-personal transitive verbs, who also have an indirect object. 


For example, **_qəzəjtaːɕ_** _he gave it to me_ has the same indirect object as **_qəzapɬaːɕ_**, only that it fused together with the 3rd person marker **_əj_**, from **_qəza- + jə_**.

2-personal intransitive verbs have the order "subject object", while 2-personal transitive verbs have the order "object subject".
A good example of this are the two verbs **_gʷərəʔʷan_** and **_qəgʷərəʔʷan_**, the former is intransitive, the latter is transitive.
>- **_səgʷərawʔʷa_** vs **_qəzgʷərawʔʷa_** - _I agree with Y_ vs _I understand Y_
>- **_zgʷərawʔʷa_** vs **_səqəgʷərawʔʷa_** - _X agrees with me_ vs _X understands me_
>- **_səbgʷərawʔʷa_** vs **_wəqəzgʷərawʔʷa_** - _I agree with you_ vs _I understand you_
>- **_wəzgʷərawʔʷa_** vs **_səqəbgʷərawʔʷa_** - _you agree with me_ vs _you understand me_
>- **_сыкъыбгурыIуэрэ_** /**_səqəbgʷərəʔʷara_**/
>- **_səbgʷərəʔʷarqəm_** vs **_wəqəzgʷərəʔʷarqəm_** - _I don't agree with you_ vs _I don't understand you_
>- **_zgʷərəʔʷa_** vs **_səqəgʷərəʔʷa_** - _agree with me!_ vs _understand me!_
>- **_zgʷərəwməʔʷa_** vs **_səqəgʷərəwməʔʷa_** - _don't agree with me!_ vs _don't understand me!

As you can see, the personal prefixes are more or less switched

>- **_sa wa sənawpɬ_** - _I look at you_
>- **_sa wa wəsɬaːʁʷ_** - _I see you_
>- **_səj aːdar səj aːnam jawpɬ_** - _my father looked at my mother_
>- **_səj aːdam səj aːnar jaɬaːʁʷ_** - _my father sees my mother_

# Dynamic vs Static
Dynamicity is another major distinction, whether the verb is static or dynamic. The rule of thumb is that dynamic verbs are more action-like, while static verbs are more state/adjective-like. I fact, every noun can be turned into a static verb with the meaning of _to be NOUN_.

Dynamic verbs have the signature **_о-_** prefix, which only appears in the positive indicative present tense, and the suffix **_-р_** which appears in some forms, however when it is the last element it is optional.

>- **_плъэн_** - _to look_
>	- **_соплъэ(р)_** - _I look_
>	- **_сыплъэркъым_** - _I don't look_

Static verbs do not get the **_о-_** prefix and in a sense replace the partially optional **_р_** with the required **_щ_**, however their distribution differse.
>- **_щытын_** - _to stand_
>	- **_сыщытщ_** - _I stand_
>	- **_сыщыткъым_** - _I don't stand_


Another thing, is also whether the verb is simple or whether it has some sort of prefix, preverb, causative etc attached to it.


There

Dynamic verbs get the **_aw-_** prefix in the present indicative.

**_ma-_** occurs in simple 1-personal intr. verbs in the 3rd person.
**_jaw-_** occurs in simple 2-personal intr. verbs in the 3rd person.

Only transitive preverbless verbs can have a distinct plural 3rd person.

## intr. 1-pers. base
This is about intranstivie verbs with only 1 person without any preverbs.

Verbs which use that conjugation are:
>- **_ʒan_** (**_maːʒa(r)_**) - _to run_
>- **_ʑan_** (**_maːʑa(r)_**) - _to boil/fry/roast_
>- **_psaɬan_** (**_mapsaːɬa(r)_**) - _to speak_

>- **_txan_** (**_maːtxa(r)_**) - _to write_
>- **_ɮaʑan_** (**_maɮaːʑa(r)_**) - _to work_
>- **_dəħaʃxən_** (**_madəħaʃx(ər)_**) - _to laugh_

>...
>- **_fʼafʼən_** (**_fʼafʼɕ_**) - _to like Y_

In the present tense, static verbs have the suffix **_-ɕ_**, while dynamic verbs have the prefix **_aw-_** and the optional suffix **_-r_**.

The subject (absolutive -r) markers are: **_sə-_**, **_wə-_**, **_∅-_**, **_də-_**, **_fə-_**, **_∅-_**.

The **_aw-_** prefix is a regular sound change from **_əwa_**. Meaning the actual prefix is **_*wa-_**, but it has sound changed beyond recognition and is only found through analysis. **_ma-_** seems also to be a development of **_*wa-_**, wher the **_w_** got hardened to **_m_**. This makes sense since **_ma-_** is used everywhere where **_aw-_** is used, but only in the third person.

To summerize, **_saw-_**, **_waw-_**, **_ma-_**, **_daw-_**, **_faw-_** come from **_*səwa-_**, **_*wəwa-_**, **_*wa-_**, **_*dəwa-_**, **_*fəwa-_**, respectively.

>- **__**

Below is the basic table for this conjugation. That is the table without the **_aw-_** taken into account.

|     |me   |you |him/her/it|us   |y'all |them|
|-----|-----|----|----------|-----|------|----|
|I    |(səza-)|sənaw-|saj-|%|səva-|saj-|
|you  |wəqəza-|(wəza-)|waj-|wəqəda-|%|waj-|
|he   |qəza-|qaw-|ja-(/za-)|qəda-|qəva-|ja-|
|we   |%|dənaw-|daj-|(dəza-)|dəva-|daj-|
|y'all|fəqəza-|%|faj-|fəqəda-|(fəza-)|faj-|
|they |qəza-|qaw-|ja-|qəda-|qəva-|ja-(/za-)|

The subject (absolutive -r) markers are: **_sə-_**, **_wə-_**, **_∅-_**, **_də-_**, **_fə-_**, **_∅-_**.

The object (ergative -m) markers are: **_za-_**, **_wa-_**, **_ja-_**, **_da-_**, **_va-_**, **_ja-_**. **za-** and **va-** come originally from **sa-** and **fa-**, respectively. The consonants simply get voiced in their intervocalic position. In fact, those markers mark the indirect object.

Whenever the subject has a "higher" person than the object or (only in case of the third person) equal to the object, then a **_qə-_** is inserted. This is a fossilized cislocative preverb **_qa-/qə-_** which is now required in preverbless intransitive verbs. 

This was probably initially motivated to differentiate between the reflexive verb form, which uses the prefix **_za-_**, and when the verb has the first personal singular as its object, which also uses **_za-_** (originally **_sa-_**). Later on it also spread to other persons where it was not ambiguous.

Something similar we also have when the subject is the first person and the object is second person singular, there instead of having the expected **_*saw-_** and **_*daw-_** (which are regular sound changes from **_*səwa-_** and **_*dəwa-_**), we have **_sənaw-_** and **_dənaw-_**. There the same happened as above, only that a **_na-_** preverb got inserted. This was also maybe motivated to reduce ambiguity, with first person forms with the prefix **_aw-_**.

Also, **_qaw-_** comes from the regular sound change from **_*qəwa-_**. The same with, **_sənaw-_** and **_dənaw-_** which come from **_*sənəwa-_** and **_*dənəwa-_**.


To get the positive present tense form, we add replace the last vowel/diphthong with **aw-**.

|     |me   |you |him/her/it|us   |y'all |them|
|-----|-----|----|----------|-----|------|----|
|I    |(səzaw)|sənaw-|saw-|%|səvaw-|saw-|
|you  |wəqəzaw-|(wəzaw)|waw-|wəqədaw-|%|waw-|
|he   |qəzaw-|qaw-|jaw-(/zaw-)|qədaw-|qəvaw-|jaw-|
|we   |%|dənaw-|daw-|(dəzaw-)|dəvaw-|daw-|
|y'all|fəqəzaw-|%|faw-|fəqədaw-|(fəzaw)|faw-|
|they |qəzaw-|qaw-|jaw-|qədaw-|qəvaw-|jaw-(/zaw-)|

Orginally **_saw-_**, **waw-** etc, probably came from **_s-jaw_**, **_w-jaw-_** but were simplified. **jaw** on the other hand seems to be the fusion of **_ja-_** and **aw-**.

One might note, that for a 1st person marker, plural or singular, as a subject and the 2nd person singular as the object, there is no change, whether with or wihout the **_aw-_** prefix.

### Reflexives
For the reflexive, one uses **_za-_** plus frequently with the suffix **_-ʒə_** (which is usually only done with intransitive verbs).
>- **_səzawpɬəʒ_**, **_səzapɬəʒərqəm_** - _I look at myself_, _I don't look at myself_
>- **_wəzawpɬəʒ_**, **_wəzapɬəʒərqəm_** - _you look at yourself_, _yu don't look at yourself_
>- **_zawpɬəʒ_**, **_zapɬəʒərqəm_** - _he looks at himself_, _he doesn't look at himself_
>- **_səzawpɬ_**, **_səzapɬərqəm_** - _I look at myself_, _I don't look at myself_
>- **_wəzawpɬ_**, **_wəzapɬərqəm_** - _you look at yourself_, _yu don't look at yourself_
>- **_zawpɬ_**, **_zapɬərqəm_** - _he looks at himself_, _he doesn't look at himself_


### Fake 2-pers verbs
There are some verbs which morphologically look like 2-personal intransitive verbs, but actually are only 1-personal verbs, in the sense that they can only conjugate for the subject, which normally would require them to use the conjugation of 1-personal intransitive verbs.

Those verbs are:
>- **_jasən_** (**_jaws_**) - _to swim_
>- **_jatʼəsaxən_** (**_jawtʼəsax_**) - _to sit down_
>- **_jaʃən_** (**_jawʃ_**) - _to get tired_
>- **_japɬatʃʼən_** (**_jawpɬatʃʼ_**) - _to look around_



## intr. 2-pers. preverb
Verbs which use that conjugation are:
>- **_qajdʒan_** (**_qawdʒa_**) - _to call Y_, _to read Y_
>- **_gərəʔʷan_** (**_gʷərawʔʷa_**) - _to agree with Y_
>- **_tʃʼaɬəkʷʼan_** (**_tʃʼaɬawkʷʼa_**) - _to follow Y_
>- **_jəʔan_** (**_jəʔaɕ_**) - _to belong to Y_ (usually translated as _to have X_, where the object is translated as the subject and vice versa)

- **_səjʔaɕ_** - _I have him_/_he belongs to me_
- **_wəzəjʔaɕ_** - _I have you_/_you belong to me_
- **_səwəjʔaɕ_** - _you have me_/_I belong to you_
- **_sərəjʔaɕ_** - _he has me_/_I belong to him_

The subject (ergative -m) markers are: **_s-_**, **_w-/p-_**, **_jə-_**, **_d-_**, **_f-_**, **_jaː-_**.

The object (absolutive -r) markers are: **_sə-_**, **_wə-_**, **_∅-_**, **_də-_**, **_fə-_**, **_∅-_**.


To create the present tense form, replaces **_əj_** with **_aj_**,  and **aː** stays **_aː_**, everywhere else one adds **aw**. **_baw-_** has the various **_waw-_**.
The above table is only a simplified table. One has to transform the given prefixes, depending on the form of the verb.

If the verb, starts with a **_wə_**, one adds a schwa **_ə_** to the last consontant. Like **_wəbədən_** (_to hold/grab Y_), **_wəxən_** (_to end Y_), **_wəbɮan_** (to begin Y).
>- **_səwəbədaːɕ_** - _I grabbed it_
>- **_bəwəxaːɕ_** - _you ended it_
>- **_dəwəbɮaːɕ_** - _we started it_
>- **_fəwəbɮaːɕ_** - _y'all started it_

If the verb starts with a voiced consonant, ending consontant becomes or stays voiced.
	
If the verb starts with a voiceless consonant, ending consontant becomes or stays voiceless.


### Reflexives
For reflexives one uses **_zə-_**.

>- **_zəzawtħaɕʼ_**, **_zəstħaɕʼərqəm_** - _I wash myself_, _I don't wash myself_
>- **_zəbawtħaɕʼ_**, **_zəptħaɕʼərqəm_** - _you wash yourself_, _you don't wash yourself_
>- **_zajtħaɕʼ_**, **_zəjtħaɕʼərqəm_** - _he washes himself_, _he doesn't wash himself_

>- **zəjwətʃʼaːɕ** - _he killed himself_

## tr. 2-pers. preverb   
Verbs which use that conjugation are:
>- **_zaxaxən_** (**_zaxajx_**) - _to hear Y_
