- **_идзын_** (**_иредз_**) _to throw Y from within Z_ 
- **_идзэн_** (**_иредзэ_**) _to throw Y to/into Z_



Ablaut alteration can have many several meanings.

It can denote transitivity change **_тхэн_** _to write_ to **_тхын_** _to write Y_. In those cases, **_э_** denotes always intransitive and **_ы_** always transitive. There may be outliers, but I did not find them.

It can also denote direction. **_э_** denotes a direction towards something, while **_ы_** denotes a direction away from something (sometimes in combination with the preverb **_къэ-_**, probably to remove ambiguities). **_илъэтэн_** _to fly into X inside_ vs **_илъэтын_** _to fly out of X inside_. Since **_илъэтащ_** could denote both cases, the away direction is augmented with **_къэ-_**, **_къилъэтащ_**.
