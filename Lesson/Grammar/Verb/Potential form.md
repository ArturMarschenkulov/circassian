# Prefix хуэ-
This form is only possible with transitive verbs.

There the agent/subject in the ergative gets promotes/demontes to the indirect object of the potential prefix **_хуэ-_**.

**_сшхыркъым_** - _I don't eat it_
**_схуэшхыркъым_** - _I can't eat it_

**_сошх_** vs **_схуошх_** - _I eat it_ vs _I can eat it_
**_сшхащ_** vs **_схуэшхащ_** - _I ate it_ vs _I could eat it/I was able to eat it_


>**_мыщэм сэ сешх_** - _the bear eats me_
>**_мыщэм сэ сыхуошх_** - _the bear can eat me_
>**_мыщэм сэ сишхащ_** - _the bear ate me_
>**_мыщэм сэ сыхуэшхащ_** - _the bear was able to eat me_




## Possible origins
One possible origin of this prefix is the homophone prefix **_хуэ-_** which denotes the beneficiary of an action.

The idea is that the following happened:
> **_мыщэм сэ сишхащ_** - _the bear ate me_

Then it got "passivized", by removing the ergative marker of the transitive verb. The below is a not a grammaticall correct form.
> **_сэ сышхащ_** - _I was/am eaten_

Then the agent was again reintroduced as the indirect object of the beneficiary preverb **_хуэ-_**.
> **_мыщэм сэ сыхуэшхащ_** - _I was/am eaten for the bear _
