It is useful to differentiate verbs depending on their semenatic content, because this can help out how the grammar works on it plus what types of derivation is possible, usually speaking.

Kabardian verbs are usually derived verbs, so I will try to only give the most sensible minimal roots.

On this page I will also try to gather all the "basic roots", mainly for verbs, but others as well.


# Temp
This is a temporary location for basic stems I have found.

- **_лъэIуэн_** - _to request_
- **_бгэн_** - _to curse_


# Verbs of motion
Verbs of motion are:
>- **_лъэтэн_** - _to fly_
>- **_кIуэтэн_** - _to move_
>- **_пщын_** - _to crawl_
>- **_жэн_** - _to run_
>- **_кIэн_**
>- **_лъэдэн_** - _to run fast_
>- **_лъэн_** - _to jump_
>- ?**_цIэфтэн_**
>-  ==
>- **_шэн_** - _to lead Y_
>- **_лъэфын_** - _to drag Y_
>- **_дзын_** - _to throw Y_
>- **_хьын_**

Such verbs have the specialty that ablaut alteration leads to direction change. **_э_** refers to motion towards something, while **_ы_** refers to motion away from something.

# Bound stems
Note: There is another term for that.

Kabardian has a few verbal stems with a clear meaning, where maybe in the past was also used by itself, but now it has to be used bounded with some other morpheme.

Those bound roots' basic forms are usually with the preverb **_щы-_**.
>- **_сы-_** refers to sitting. **_щысын_** - _to sit_
>- **_ты-_** refers to standing. **_щытын_** - _to stand_
>- **_лъы-_** refers to lying. **_щылъын_** - _to lie_
>- 
>- **_ɕat-_** refers to falling or slipping from something. **_ɕəɕatən_** - _to fall/slip from Y_
## хьэ-, кIы-, хы-, и-
The below are special, as they can be suffixed to verbs as well as being combined with preverbs.
>- **_хьэ-_** refers to moving towards (entering).
>- **_кIы-_** refers to moving away (exiting).
>- **_хы-_** refers to moving down.
>- **_и-_** refers to moving up.

They are all used slightly different and are not really that "parallel" as the other ones, but they are still quite similar in how they are used.

**_хьэ-_** is especially frequently used with 
## гъы-
**_гъы_** as a bound stem (the unbound stem usually means _to cry_) means something in regards to wearing clothes. This bound prefix is usually combined with preverbs denoting body parts.
- **__** - _to be clothed on a head_
- **_лъыгъын_** - _to be clothed on the legs_
- **_щыгъын_** - _to be clothed on Y_
- **_Iыгъын_** - _to hold Y_

**_Iыгъын_** is the one sticking out, since there it is in fact not bound to the rare preverb **_Iы-_**, but actually fused with it. This can be seen that **_Iыгъын_** does not seem to form a causative form.
- **_щхьэрыгъагъын_** - _to wear Y on the head_
- **_лъыгъагъын_** - _to wear Y on the legs_
- **_щыгъагъын_** - _to wear Y_ (???)
There does not seem to be a form like **_*Iыгъагъын_** or **_*егъэIыгъын_**, however there is **_Iэрыгъагъын_**

# Verbs based on how they interact with common vallency change.

Verbs chose basic 1 to 2 valency change is done by changing transitivity + alternate ablaut
**_тхэн_** _to write_
**_шхэн_** _to eat_
**_псэлъэн_** _to talk_


**_плъэн_** _to look_
**_лъэIуэн_** _to ask_
**_бгэн_** _to curse_
**_бэнэн_** _to fight_
**_Iэбэн_** _to touch_



# Classes in terms of preverbs
I am creating classes of verbs which determine the rules of how they get various preverbs.

## Class A
This class before getting a preverb it gets an ablaut change from **_ы_** to **_э_**.

**_лагъун_** -> **_телъэгъуэн_**


## Class B
Before getting preverbs **_э_** to **_ы_**,


## Class C
Requires a directional suffix.

- **_тхэн_** -> **_тетхыхьын_**
