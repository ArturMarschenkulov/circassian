This note is about giving an introduction to the verb system of Kabardian. The verb conjugation system of Kabardian is rather complicated, but as a start it should be enough.

# Ergativity

The most important thing before one starts to understands the verb is to understand that Kabardian is an ergative language, this is different from accusative languages. Most languages you probably know are accusative languages, for example English, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, German etc. In fact, around and in Europe only Basque and Caucasian languages, like Circassian, Georgian, etc, are ergative.

In essence, ergative languages differ from accusative languages by how the subject of the sentence is marked depending on the verb's transitivity. While transitivity is expressed differently in different languages, the rough gist is that base intransitive verbs have only a subject, while base transitive verbs have a subject and a (direct) object. In an accusative language, while not always accurate, one can say that the main cases are the nominative and accusative case. The main cases in ergative languages are absolutive and ergative. In case of Circassian, unfortunately the established tradition is to call the absolutive case the nominative case. This might create confusion, thus I will not use that to describe the absolutive case.

In accusative languages, it does not matter what the transitivity is of the verb, the subject is usually expressed by the nominative case.

- **_He looks_**. 
	- **_to look_** is intransitive. The subject is **_he_** and is in the nominative case. One cannot say **_he looks him_**, to express that meaning one would have to say **_he looks at him_**, but that is not a base form as one added **_at_** to the verb and in this context **_him_** would be an indirect object and not a direct object.
- **_He sees him_**
	- **_to see_** is transitive. The subject **_he_** is in the nominative case, with the direct object **_him_** being in the accusative case. While one can say **_he sees_** it is not the primary meaning and usually it still implies an direct object.

Note English is a rather bad showcase language for this, as it has lost case distinction in many places, except a few, like pronouns. Languages like Russian and Turkish are better for that.


In Kabardian, however the subject of an intrasitive verb is expressed by the absolutive case. The subject of a transitive verb is expressed by the ergative case, while the direct object is expressed by the accusative.

- **_ар плъэнщ_** - _he/she/it will look_
	- **_плъэн_** is intransitive, with the subject **_ар_** being in the absolutive case.
- **_абы ар илъагъунщ_** - _he/she/it will see it/him/her_
	- **_лъагъун_** is transitive, with the subject **_абы_** being in the ergative case and the (direct) object being in the absolutive case.


Another way to think about it, is to think of transitive verbs as passive verbs. Compare **_he looks_** and **_he is seen by him_**. You can imagine that **_he_** is in the absolutive case, while **_by him_** is in the ergative case. This is not how the verb forms are perceived by speakers, but this gives you an idea of how to understand ergative languages.

This analogy can be further showcased by comparing **_сэ сыплъэнщ_** _I'll look_ and **_абы сэ силъагъунщ_** _he'll see me_, or as we learned _I'm seen by him_. **_сы-_** is the absolutive personal marker (it is reduced to **_с-_** before **_и-_**) for the singular first person, **_и-_** is the ergative personal marker for the singular third person. You simply imagine **_и-_** as a verb marker which means _by him/her/it_.

# Personal marking
As one might have noticed, Kabardian marks not only one person on its verb, like most languages, but it can mark several. It is has polypersonal agreement, and thus phrases like **_he sees me_** can be thought of as being expressed as **_he me me-he-see_**.

Below are the person markers. As you can see, the absolutive and ergative forms are related to each other, with the absolutive form having a **_ы-_** and the absolutive lacking any marker for the third person. In fact, the first and second person markers are related to the personal pronouns **_сэ_**, **_уэ_**, **_дэ_** and **_фэ_**.

|  | Absolutive | Ergative |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| sing. first | сы- | с- |
| sing. second | у(ы) - | у- (/б-) |
| sing. third | - | и- |
| plur. first | ды- | д- |
| plur. second | фы- | ф- |
| plur. third | - | я- |


Unfortunately it is not as easy as simply remembering those markers, as those markers interact with its surroundings. One very important interaction is the sound change to voiced or unvoiced. Before an unvoiced consonant, a consonant becomes unvoiced, resulting into **_п-_** and **_т-_**. 
- **_уолъэгъу_** _you see it_ becomes **_плъэгъуащ_** _you saw it_
- **_долъэгъу_** _we see it_ becomes **_тлъэгъуащ_** _we saw it_

Before voiced consonants, the consonant becomes voiced, resulting into **_з-_**, **_б-_** and **_в-_**.

- **_содз_** _I throw it_ becomes **_здзащ_** _I threw it_
- **_уодз_** _you throw it_ becomes **_бдзащ_** _you threw it_
- **_фодз_** _y'all throw it_ becomes **_вдзащ_** _y'all threw it_

 Since only the ergatives have consonant which touch, they change the most. However also absolutive ones, become voiced when between vowels.
 - **_къызэплъынщ_** - _he'll look at me_
 - **къопъынщ** - _he'll look at you_

A quite special on is the singular second markers, aka _you_. It's special for two reasons, because of orthography and because of phonology. A quirk of Kabardian orthology is that that usually **_у_** and **_и_** are shorthand versions of **_уы_** and **_йы_**. Unfortunately, **_у_** does not have **_ў_**, similar how **_и_** has **_й_**, thus **_у_** has double duty. The problem however is that the base form of the ergative singular second person marker is more aptly described as **_ў_**, as a very short **у** and that is the reason why it is usually seen as **п-** or **_б-_** depending on whether the consonant is voiced or unvoiced respectively. It has only the form of **_у-_** sometimes when it is between vowels or in special configurations. And even then between vowels one frequently simply uses **_б-_** and in those special configurations it fuses with other vowels. Thus it is surprisingly difficult to spot that base form, but it is there and it might help understand the sound changes.

- **_услъагъунщ_** - _I'll see you_
- **_сыплъагъунщ_** - _you'll see me_




# The present tense prefix о-/мэ-
Before talking about the big topic of prefixes in Kabardian, one needs to talk about the special prefix **_о-_**/**_мэ-_**.

This is an important prefix which only happens in the positive affirmative present tense with dynamic verbs. It its usage it is somewhat analogous to English's **_-s_**, as it also only happens in a very specific case and otherwise verbs have rarely any markings. The **_о-_** prefix is similarly only used in that one setting and is otherwise not used, but because it is a frequent setting it is important to learn.

This prefix has quite a lot of phonological interaction with its environment.

When at the start of word, it is **_мэ-_**:
- **_маплъэ_** - _he/she looks_
- **_матхэ_** - _he writes_

When inside a word, it is **_о-_**:
- **_йоплъ_** - _he/she looks at it_ (cf. **_е-_**+**_о-_**=**_йо-_**)
- **_соплъ_** - _I look_ (cf. **_с-_**+**_йо-_**=**_со-_**)


If it is before the third person singular ergative person marker **_и-_**, it fuses with it into **_е-_**:
- **_елъэгъу_** - _he sees it_ (cf. **_и-_**+**_o-_**)
- **_етх_** - _he writes it_


Actually because of the interactions of the **_о-_** prefix with its environment it creates some ambiguities and those might be confusing for language learners. For example, let's take the word forms **_сотхэ_** _I write_ and **_сотх_** _I write it_, one might think that the main morphological difference between them is this **_э_**, but in fact the **_с_** of the first one comes from absolutive **_сы-_**, while of the second one, it comes from the ergative **_с-_**. Note, **_тхэн_** is an intransitive verb and means _to write_ as in writing in general, while **_тхын_** is transitive and means _to write Y_, aka write something specific.

The above mentioned ambiguity might not be a major problem, however one has also the case of **_соплъэ_** _I look_ and **_соплъ_** _I look at it_. If one simply took the above example by analogy one would again assume a intransitive transitive pair, but you would be mistaken. The pair is not **_плъэн_** and **_плъын_**, but **_плъэн_** and **_еплъын_** and both are intransitive verbs. This is because the combination of **_сы+е+о_** fuses to **_со-_**.

This means that verbs with **_о-_** can be more ambiguous and as a learner one has to watch one and keep that stuff in mind.

Another source of confusion might be that **_и-_** and **_о-_** fuse into **_е-_**, which looks the same as the **_e-_** preverb. The good thing is that the both forms have mutual exclusive distribution.


## Reduction of other preverbs
This prefix causes other preverbs to appear in their reduced form, if that is different from their full form.

For example, **_тесхащ_** _I took it from above it_ becomes **_тызох_** _I take it from above it_. The preverb **_те-_** reduces to **_ты-_**.

In fact this happens very frequently anyways whenever more than 2 preverbs are used. The rightmost preverb/prefix is in its full form, while every preverb to the left is in its reduces form. But since interaction with the prefix **_о-_** is crucial to understand, it is treated in a special way. 
- **_къэкIуэн_** - _to come_ becomes **_къыдэкIуэн_** - _to come together with Y_
# Preverbs/prefixes

Preverbs are a major and central part of the Kabardian verb. To get a conceptual understanding, you can imagine it as if English would fuse together it's verb + preposition phrasal verbs into simply the verb. That means, instead of saying **_I looked at you_**, one would say **_I at-looked you_** or something along those lines.
- **_I live in a city_** becomes **_I in-live a city_**
- **_I bought food for you_** becomes **_I for-bought food you_**

We have already met some preverbs beforehand in this blog, like **_те-_**, **_къэ-_**, **_е-_**, etc.
