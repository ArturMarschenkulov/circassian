Kabardian has a bunch of preverbs



# Ordering
Some preverbs can be combined and some are mutually exclusive.

**_е-_** is the closest possible. It is the most grammaticalized prefix, meaning it is more abstract and serves more of a general grammatical meaning, then a certain one. One of the reasons why it is the closest possible and not considered mutual exclusive with certain other prefixes is because it has a special usage with the causative prefix **_гъэ-_**.

**_щы-_**/**_и-_**/**_дэ-_**/**_хэ-_**/**_те-_**/**_щIэ-_** all seem to follow the former, with **_те-_** actually being probably derived from **_е-_** in some way. They all seem mutually exclusive, but **_и-_**/**_дэ-_**/**_хэ-_** seem to be the most mutually exclusive. I think I have seen this trio in combination with the other two somewhere. However while I think those are the most basic and frequent preverbs there are others which might also be mutually exclusive but I did not put them here because I have seen relatively little examples: **_блэ-_**/**_къуэ-_**/**_фIэ-_**/**_гуэ-_**/**_Iу-_**. All of them are characterized by that the meanings can only exist in the context of the preverbs.

The next group consists of preverbs which are less grammaticalized and generally have a meaning also outside the preverb context. This is also the group which has the most preverbs which can only exist with the former group, something similar to **_те-_**. **_лъы-_**/**_кIэлъы-_**/**_пэ-_**/**_къуэцI-_**/**_бгъэ(дэ)-_**/**_бгъуры-_**/**_кIэры-_**

.

**_къы-_**/**_нэ-_** are the farthest possible. They are mutually exclusive.


# List

## Iы-
This preverb denotes the hand and is derived from **Iэ** _hand_.

The only case where I have found it to be used like a preverb is **_Iыхын_** _to take Y from Z's hand(s)_, it being a transitive verb thus resulting into **_Iех_** _X takes Y from Z's hands_. It is quite analogous with **_лъыхын_**.



Another one which might be thought of as a contender is **_Iыгъын_**, however there it seems that it is actually fused together with the root, as one does not say **_*Iигъ_**, but **_иIыгъ_**. Even more strange is that this verb is actually transitive and static, AFAIK this is the only verb which behaves like that. Its **_лъы-_** analogue is **_лъыгъын_**, but it is static and intransitive.

# Iэры-
As the above one, it also denotes the hand.

- **_Iэрыхын_** - _to remove Y from the hand_
- **_Iэрыху_** - _to fall from hands_
- **_Iэрыхьэн_** - __
- **_Iэрылъхьэн_** - __
