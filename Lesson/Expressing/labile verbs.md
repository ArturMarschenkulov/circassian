Basically verbs which are little bit weird in regards to their transitivity and usage.


- **_иIэн_** - _to have Y_
- **_щыгъупщэн_** - _to forget Y_
- **_фIэфIын_**


**_щыгъупщэн_** is weird because it is intransitive with preverb **_щы-_**. However the object of the preverb **_щы-_** is the subject, while in the slot which is usually the subject of an intransitive verb, aka the absolutive person prefix, is the object. **_сыпщыгъупщэ_** is _you forget me_ compare **_сыпщыIэ_** _I am at you_.

However **_щыгъупщэн_** is an incomplete verb. For example it is not possible to put it into a imperative form. One has to use **_егъэщыгъупщэн_**, **_зыщумыгъэгъупщэ_** _don't forget_ lit. _do not make yourself forget_.

**_къыгурыIуэн_** - _to understand Y_ is similar to **_щыгъупщэн_**, only that **_къы-_** seems to cause this inversion, as **_гурыIуэн_** _to agree with Y_ does not have this and it is treated like a normal intransitive verb.
