This stem is interesting because depending on its usage it can mean completely different things. It is an interesting example of the interplay between transitivity and the ablaut **_-э_**/**_-ы_** alteration For example:
 - **_къикIын_** (intr.)- _to exit Y_
 - **_къикIэн_** (intr.) - _to grow inside Y_
 - **_къикIэн_** (tr.) - _to pour Y into Z_
**_къикIэн_** _to grow inside Y_ is derived from **_кIын_** _to grow_. It is a verb that if a locative preverb is prefixed, the **_-ы_** turns into an **_-э_**. **_къикIэн_** _to pour Y into Z_ on the other hand comes from the bound stem **_-кIэ_** which means _to pour_. **_къикIын_** _to exit Y_ comes from the bound stem **_-кIы_** which refers to moving away. In all three cases, **_къи-_** refers to the two preverbs **_къэ-_** and **_и-_**. 

- **_сэ автобусым сыкъикIащ_** - _I got off the bus_
- **_сэ стэчаным шэ къискIащ_** - _I poured milk into a cup_
